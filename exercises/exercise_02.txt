Consider the initial Customers table structure (exercise_01.txt)

1) Identify Dependencies:
Analyze the table to identify functional dependencies and potential redundancy.

2) Create New Tables:
Create new tables to represent entities that are dependent on the primary key and contain non-prime attributes.

3) Populate New Tables:
Insert data into the newly created tables.

4) Review and Refine:
Review the new structure to ensure that it adheres to normalization principles.
Refine the tables and relationships if necessary.

This exercise guides your students through the process of normalizing the Customers table by creating a separate Address table and establishing a foreign key relationship. It encourages them to think about reducing redundancy and organizing the data efficiently.
